# study-quiz-game

Think Fast! is a unique quiz style game to test your knowledge against your friends. Make your way through the silly questions and race against the clock. Each correct answer will advance to the next question, while each incorrect answer will result in points taken away from the game clock / scoreboard.

The assignment to develop this timed style game is to work on our javascript coding skills and practice the basic javascript language I have learned so far. 

The hardest part for me was building the page  dynamically while developing the functions to carry the app from page to page. Another challenge was utilizing the local storage to store and retrieve data.

One thing I am proud of was solving the for loop to build the buttons and storing the questions and answers objects from an array. Although there are still some quirks to the design and a few things should be done differently, that was tough!

I hope you enjoy, Thanks for reading!
